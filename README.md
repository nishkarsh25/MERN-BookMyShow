# MERN Stack BookMyShow Project

Welcome to the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack project! This comprehensive guide will walk you through every aspect of this project, including its structure, setup instructions, usage, API endpoints, backend, frontend, contributing guidelines, license information, and how to get in touch for support or inquiries.

## Introduction

This project is a Movie Ticket Booking System implemented using React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js for the backend. It allows users to browse available movies, select time slots, choose seats, and book movie tickets.

**Features:**

1. **Select Movie:** Users can browse through a list of available movies and select the one they want to watch.

2. **Select Time Slot:** Users can choose from various time slots available for the selected movie.

3. **Select Seats:** Users can choose their preferred seats for the selected movie and time slot.

4. **Book Tickets:** Once all selections are made, users can proceed to book their tickets. The system validates the user's selections and confirms the booking.

5. **View Last Booking Details:** Users can view details of their last booking, including the selected seats, movie, and time slot.

6. **Error Handling:** The system provides error messages for invalid selections or failed booking attempts.

## Technologies Used

The project leverages the power of modern web technologies to create a seamless user experience:

- **Frontend:**
  - React.js: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - React Router: Used for routing within the React application.
  - Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend.
  - Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom designs.

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for building server-side applications.
  - Express.js: A minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
  - MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing application data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nishkarsh25/MERN-LoginAndRegistration.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout <branch-name>
   ```
   Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to checkout.
   
3. Start the Backend Server: Launch the backend Node.js server.

   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```
4. Start the Frontend Development Server: Run the React development server for the frontend application.

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage
